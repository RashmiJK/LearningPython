1. How to see list of functions inside module in Python
    dir(module_name)

2. Anaconda python distribution can be installed from https://www.continuum.io/downloads

3. Third party packages of interest here : 
*numpy 
*imatplotlib
*ipython - error
*jupyter notebook
*requests
*bs4
*pillow
*flask
*basemap - error - used below to overcome error
	[1] Installed brew - package manager for MAC
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	This is to install geos

	[2] Then tried brew install geos
	Seems like worked successfully

	[3] pip3 install https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/archive/v1.1.0.tar.gz
	Shows message as success, but when imported in IDLE, it shows error

	[4] Downgrade pyproj to version 1.9.6 using below command
	pip3 install pyproj==1.9.6
	This is done to overcome the error

		>>> from mpl_toolkits.basemap import Basemap
		Traceback (most recent call last):
  		File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  		File "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/lib/python3.7/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap/__init__.py", line 152, in <module>
    		epsgf = open(os.path.join(pyproj.pyproj_datadir,'epsg'))
		AttributeError: module 'pyproj' has no attribute 'pyproj_datadir'

	[5] In python3 IDLE, run the following
	>>> import mpl_toolkits
	>>> import mpl_toolkits.basemap
*geopy
*line_profiler - error - used below to overcome error
	git clone https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler.git
	find line_profiler -name '*.pyx' -exec cython {} \;
	cd line_profiler && pip install . --user 
*memory_profiler

4. String -> List : use split() method
   List -> String : use join() method

5. Negative indexing in slicing
   -1 is the last element
   Slicing happens until (last mentioned index -1)

6. Looping through dictionaries
   for key,value in dict.items()

7. Comprehensions - They are the way to run a loop within a single line of code and
    to collect the results of the loop in a collection

8. Generators : Shirtcut to wrote functions that implement iterators
